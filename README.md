# LandingPage2
This is my second run at a Landing page from The Odin Project, I am using some of my projects as links. You can check out the project here https://dubonk.github.io/LandingPage2/
website should be mobile friendly 


Possible features in the future: 
An api that will add the movie cover when it is added, maybe an auto complete when typing movie name.
